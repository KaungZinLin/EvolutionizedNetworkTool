=====HELLO EVERYONE!=====
Today, I've decided to make changes in the Network Tool that you can use with the Shortcuts app on Mac.

=====MODIFIED VERSION DOWNLOAD LINK=====

=====CREDITS=====
Original Version: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1c44d8f2c7dd45d6a041f669ccce4baf

=====MODIFICATIONS=====
Changed the method of doing a Speedtest.

Instead of opening up 'https://fast.com/' and getting the Speedtest result by looking at the Safari WebView, it nows gets the Speedtest results with the macOS Terminal.

=====BENEFITS OF USING THIS METHOD=====
Gets more infomation. Such as; Uplink Capacity (Upload Speed), Downlink Capacity (Download Speed), Responsiveness (e.g. Low, Medium, High) with Precise Speed in RPM and Idle Latency in Miliseconds.

=====HUGE THANKS FOR USING THIS MODIFIED VERSION OF THE SHORTCUT====
